R and Python code for creating a dataframe out of the [Forex Factory](https://www.forexfactory.com) online economic calendar.

* The `Python` code in `get_ff.py` scraps the html source page of the economic calendar for each day.
* The `R` code in `build_ff.Rmd` creates a dataframe out of these html source pages.
* The `R` code in `cleaning.Rmd` cleans the data and categorises the variables into groups, i.g. inflation.  
* The `R` code in `summary.Rmd` provides a summary of the resulting dataset.
* The data are saved with the Apache [parquet](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/parquet.html) so they can be loaded with different environment, e.g. `R`, `Pyhton`, `Matlab` etc. 

```{r}
df = arrow::read_parquet("data/df_FF_clean.parquet")

knitr::kable(tail(df), format = "html")
```
