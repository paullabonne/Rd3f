R and Python code for creating a dataframe out of the [Forex Factory](https://www.forexfactory.com) online economic calendar.

* The `Python` code in `get_ff.py` scraps the html source page of the economic calendar for each day.
* The `R` code in `build_ff.Rmd` creates a dataframe out of these html source pages.
* The `R` code in `cleaning.Rmd` cleans the data and categorises the variables into groups, i.g. inflation.  
* The `R` code in `summary.Rmd` provides a summary of the resulting dataset.

```{r, message = F}
library(dplyr)
library(knitr)
library(arrow)

df = read_parquet("data/df_FF_clean.parquet")

df_day = df %>%
  filter(date == "2023-12-08")

kable(df_day, format = "html")
```
